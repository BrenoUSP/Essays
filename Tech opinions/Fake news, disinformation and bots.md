# Fake news, disinformation and bots

*Text produced for a discussion in the podcast "Colmeia Tech". Any ideas exposed here are only thoughts from the same author of this text.*

They tell us we live in the era of information, but it could also be the era of desinformation.

## But what are fake news, disinformation and bots?

Fake news are a kind of fabricated news, usually with the intention to propagate an idea to prejudice someone or something, maybe giving even advantages to a person or a group with the detriment of others. Fake news is definitly a kind of disinformation. And it's ideal to this desinformation to be propagated massively.

To this massive propagation to occur, we have now "bots", automated systems created to do repeated functions with diverse objectives. Bots are being used to dissiminate fake news in the most fashionable way, like they are real people, giving the impression to the real ones some manipulated news can be real.

Fake news are not a new thing. In some way, we are now exposed everyday to them because of a kind of a "democratization of the media", giving the opportunity to many media outlets to be born and grow with the internet, because of the easier way to create news, differently from the 80's which only some groups had this access.

The works of Noam Chomsky, like the "Manufacturing Consent" show the powers of media manipulation. The "Five filters of the Mass Media Machine" (more about here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34LGPIXvU5M) demonstrated is an excellent way to understand how media structure can work. Now imagine this, but even more stronger. Probably, with the internet, it is exactly what we are seeing today.

## Who are affected by it?

Anyone can affected by fake news, me, the president of a country, even your dog (in a way).

- lies;
- politic game;
- examples;
- brexit, us and brazil elections;

## Deepfakes

Imagine someone making a video or a audio saying you did something illegal, this a deepfake. It's not exactly common to target a politician yet, but we can imagine this is one of the most dangerous kind of fake news.
